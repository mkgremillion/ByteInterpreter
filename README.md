A tool to extract bytes from a binary file and load it into Ruby objects.
# Next Steps
The project is quite bare right now; instead of trying to get my documentation
perfect and my Rubocop score immaculate and learning to write tests, I wanted to
put *something* out there. So, here it is, in all its unpolished glory. After all,
that's kind of the point of releasing your software to the world, isn't it?

## Documentation
The first thing I want to finish is proper YARD documentation. This should not
take very long.

## Tests
I'm still a green programmer, so I haven't ever written tests before, and I've
never worked on something big enough to write tests for. So I'll be learning with
**ByteInterpreter**.

## Code Cleanup
After that, I want to refactor and clean up the code, using Rubocop and the
community style guide.

Once all those things are in place, I have a few features in mind!
